The things an object carries around can also include functions. 
A function attached to an object is called a method. 
(Non-function things attached to an object, such as imag, are called 
attributes).

#Tuples
"""Tuples are often used for functions that have multiple return values.
For example, the as_integer_ratio() method of float objects returns a 
numerator and a denominator in the form of a tuple:
    
>>> x = 0.125
x.as_integer_ratio()
- (1, 8)

These multiple return values can be individually assigned as follows:

>>> numerator, denominator = x.as_integer_ratio()
print(numerator / denominator)
- 0.125

Finally we have some insight into the classic Stupid Python Trickâ„¢ for swapping 
two variables!
>>> a = 1
>>> b = 0
>>> a, b = b, a
>>> print(a, b)
- 0 1
